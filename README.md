## A short summary about me ðŸ‘‹
I am passionate about solving problems using programming.
I am currently a Software Engineer, working as a Fullstack Developer at Trustly, Inc. a payments company serving US and Europe.   :computer:

 <br/> :purple_heart: &nbsp; Looking to collaborate with projects using backend languages, mainly Python and mostly Java, which has been my learning focus at the moment.
 <br/> :blush: &nbsp; I can help you with CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox (and a little python and Django too :D)
 <br/> :computer: &nbsp; My stack fluctuates between these technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and Angular on the Frontend and Python, Java, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Django and some NodeJS on the Backend. In general I learn very fast and I'm proactive in solving problems.
